# CandyCo Bricks ğŸ§±

Every ğŸ§±, that I can possibly come up with and that make my life easier.

## Usage

Implement new ğŸ§± in an own directory, that lives in the folder ```bricks```. To do so, use ```mason new```. After creating the new ğŸ§±, you might want to add them to the ```mason.yaml``` of the Flutter Template Project!
